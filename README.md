Pardon that till now I have not studied about deployment. I'll (hopefully) get it online in the near future after I get the nits and grits of hosting.

So, this application will only start if your PC has BASICALLY A MERN SETUP.

There are 3 ports to be taken care of :-)
   (We can change these ports if we want to by simply editing the numbers in "backend/" files)
1) Mongo as a database at localhost:27017 (which has a collection named "notes" in a db named "note_db").
2) An ExpressJs server at localhost:3000 for fetching
3) ReactJs at any port for user interaction.
